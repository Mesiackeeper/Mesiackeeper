<p>Hello there everyone! My name is Messi, but you’re also free to call me Mesiac or any other name you can think of. I’m a huge Mezzo” fan as you can tell by my strawpage, and they both mean a lot to me. Besides Idolish7, the other fandoms I’m very into are: Fire Emblem, Blue Lock (Nagi), Idv, Honkai Star Rail, and Ensemble Stars. Feel free to come and interact with me if you’re into any of these fandoms.</p>
<br> </br>
<b>DNI OR IWEC?!</b>

- Basic Dni
- Pro shippers, etc (Dni)
- Kys, kms and any suicide related type jokes
- You will be hidden if you say those type of jokes
- Sexual jokes are a no. You will be hidden if you say them towards me
- Persona 5 fans are on thin ice. Don’t interact with me as a P5 pony unless I interact with you first
- Don’t drag me into unnecessary drama
- Don’t joke flirt with me unless you’re a friend
- Genderbends or feminizations of characters that are not canon

<br> </br>
**BFYI** You should know...

- Even though I’m a Persona 5 fan, I will rarely talk to others from the fandom. People that mischaracterize Akechi can get lost.
- Often off-tab and won’t talk first unless spoken to first.
- Sometimes will go non-verbal. When this happens I’ll only respond with emotes or won’t react at all.
- Dislike all types of sexual talk/acts, and will walk away if you start talking about it near me.
- I have a bad fear of snakes, so don’t go into detail talk about them while talking to me. All other reptiles are fine though.
- Has a bad habit of rambling on accident, so do tell me if I’m going on for too long.
- Very forgetful and has a bad memory. If I don’t remember topics I’m sorry, please bare with me
